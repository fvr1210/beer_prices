<p><h1>Beerboard</h1></p>
<h4><p>Beer and Money, two of my favorite things on this world&hellip; just kidding, I only like money because you can buy beer with it. And in switzerland you need a lot of money to buy beer.</p>
<p>Do you? Yes beer is expensive in restaurants and bars in switzerland but I don't think it is in the supermarket, where you can buy beer at low prices down to 0.50 $ for a half liter can. While travalling I never really found cheaper beer in supermarkets or small shops.</p>
<p>Sometime ago I found data about beer prices which was collected by GoEuro (now Omio) a travel where you can find, compare and buy trail, bus and flight tickets for Europe (now also for the USA and Canada, that&rsquo;s maybe the reason why they changed names&hellip;). &nbsp;This data includes among others supermarket, hotel bar and overall prices for a 0.33L beer in different cities.</p>
<p>So what do you do when you are interested in economics, data and beer? Right you build a Beer Data Dashboard aka Beerboard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With this Beerboard I know can answer questions like:</p>
<h4>With this Beerboard I know can answer questions like:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>&laquo;Is Switzerland really an expensive place to drink beer?&rdquo; (Spoiler: yes it is, especially as a tourist in a hotel bar but not so as resident when you compare it with the earnings&hellip;)</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>&laquo;Do people drink more beer in countries where beer is cheaper?&raquo;</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>&laquo;Where can people buy the most beer with their income?&raquo;</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>In the other two subsection of this info tab you find more information about the data which is used for this Beerboard. If you want to look at nice graphs switch to the City or Country Level tab.</strong></h4>
