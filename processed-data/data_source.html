<p><h2>Data Sources</h2></p>
<h4><p>For this Beerboard I use data from different sources and this sources sometimes also use further sources&hellip; I try the show on this info site the source of each number such that I don&rsquo;t have to do this in the graphs which would make them more messy. Following I name the source of the data, how the data is named in my GitHub folder, the names of the variables and the meaning of this variables</p></h4>
<h3>GoEuro Data </h3>
<h4><strong>Name of the file:</strong> world_wide_beer_prices.csv</h4>
<h4><strong>Source:</strong> The data was collected in 2015. I can&rsquo;t find a link for the raw data anymore but <a href="https://graphics.wsj.com/table/BEER_062415">here</a> is a table with the data you could probably scrap and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/go-euros-beer-price-index-shows-the-most-expensive-places-for-beer-2015-7?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T">here</a> you find a graphic produced by GoEuro with additional information I also use here. If this two will not work for you use your favorite search engine and search for &ldquo;goeuro beer index 2015&rdquo; and then choose images</h4>
<h4><strong>Variables:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><em>CITY</em> <em>&ndash; </em>75 different cities for which the data was collected</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><em>AVERAGE SUPERMARKET PRICE $ &ndash;</em> The prices of beer in a supermarket was calculated as the average cost of a 33cl bottle of several worldwide brands and a major local brand in a regular discount store.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><em>BAR PRICE $</em> <em>&ndash; </em>The price of beer in a bar was calculated using average price of local and imported 33cl draught beer in several major hotel chains worldwide.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><em>OVERALL PRICE $ &ndash; </em>The mean of the supermarket and the hotel bar price.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><em>BEER PER CAPITA/YEAR (LITERS) &ndash; </em>Data from World Health Organization</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><em>AVERAGE SPENT ON BEER PER PERSON PER YEAR $ &ndash; </em>Average based on the World Health Organisation data and GoEuro Beer Price Index</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Remarks:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>All prices were converted in USD using the Bloomberg exchange rate on June 2015.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Where beers are sold in 12ou (35.3cl) varieties vs the European standard of 33cl, GoEuro normalized prices to be equivalent to a 33cl bottle.</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Looking at the beer prices at the bar it would have be good if they have stated more prominent and not only in a footnote that the prices were collected at hotel bars. The prices seem in general a little high for me and that they were collected at a hotel bar could be a reason. In my opinion they also should have used an average exchange rate to converting to USD not just take one on a somehow random day.</h4>
<h4>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have the exact source for the consumption data. I doubt that the numbers are for 2015 since such data is mostly uploaded with delay. I&rsquo;m also not sure if this data has some faulty numbers, especially the high consumption in Vietnam seems odd. This is way I added two more sources for consumption data to the raw data base.</h4>
<h4>The data set has a European bias. This is probably due to the fact, that it was collected by a European focused website…</h4>
<h3>GHO consumption data</h3>
<h4><strong>Name of the file:</strong> beer-consumption-per-person-GHO.csv</h4>
<h4><strong>Source: </strong>The data is from the World Health Organization (WHO) data base &ldquo;Global Health Observatory&rdquo; (GHO) and can be found <a href="https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1039?lang=en">here</a>. I choose to use the consumption data for the year 2015.</h4>
<h4><strong>Variables (the dataset includes many variables, I only describe the ones I use):</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><em>GHO (DISPLAY) &ndash; </em>Alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol)</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><em>Year</em></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><em>Country (CODE) &ndash; </em>The three letter iso3c country code for each country</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><em>Country (Display) &ndash; </em>The English name for each country</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><em>Display Value &ndash; </em>The amount of Alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol)</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>ALCOHOLTYPE (DISPLAY) &ndash; 4 different types: Other alcohol beverages, Spirits, Wine, Beer, All typs</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Remarks:</strong></h4>
<h4>Due to my experience I know that you must be cautious when comparing consumption data. You find for example at least three numbers for meat consumption in Switzerland depending on the source and calculation methods (if you want to know more about this check <a href="https://novanimal.ch/2018/10/01/produktion-und-konsum-von-fleisch-in-der-schweiz/">this</a> out). So when it comes to cross country data you have to be even more careful even if they are published from one Organization. Don&rsquo;t use this numbers as exact values! Look at the as an approximation and if two countries have only small differences there is maybe no difference in the real world. The sources for the data and the calculation methods for the GHO data can be found <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/462">here</a>.</h4>
<h3>Wikipedia consumption data</h3>
<h4><strong>Name of the file:</strong> beer_consumption_wiki.csv</h4>
<h4><strong>Source: </strong>The data is scrapped from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_beer_consumption_per_capita">this</a> Wikipedia side. As in the nature of Wikipedia the source of the consumption data for the countries varies. Most data is from the Kirin Beer University Report: &ldquo;Global Beer Consumption by Country in 2018&rdquo; which can be found <a href="https://www.kirinholdings.co.jp/english/news/2019/1224_01.html">here</a> (note to myself, there is a Beer University! Have to find out how to get a job there!). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirin_Company">Wikipedia</a> says: &ldquo;<strong>Kirin Brewery Company, Limited</strong> (麒麟(キリン)麦酒(ビール)株式会社, <em>Kirin Bīru kabushiki gaisha</em>) is a Japanese integrated beverages company. It is a subsidiary of <strong>Kirin Holdings Company, Limited</strong>.

<h4><strong>Variables:</strong></h4>
<h4><em>Country </em>&ndash; 60 different countries</h4>
<h4><em>Consumption per capita (liters per year)</em> &ndash; Beer consumption measured in liters</h4>
<h4><em>2018 change (liters per year)</em> &ndash; increase or decrease of beer consumption</h4>

<h4><em>Year</em></h4>
<h4><em>Source</em> &ndash; Source of the data (see above)</h4>
<h4><strong>Remarks</strong></h4>
<h4>Since the data is cross country and from different sources, we should be even more careful when analyzing and interpreting it.</h4>
<h3>UBS earning Data</h3>
<h4><strong>Name of the file:</strong> UBS_PricesAndEarnings_OpenData.csv</h4>
<h4><strong>Source: </strong>The data for the average hourly earning is from the UBS global cities ranking which includes many other economic data for 77 cities worldwide (data found <a href="https://www.ubs.com/minisites/prices-earnings/en/open-data/">here</a>).</h4>
<h4><strong>Variables:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><em>City &ndash; &nbsp;</em>The English name for the included cities</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><em>Year &ndash;</em></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><em>Main Section &ndash; </em>A lot of different categories about earnings, prices, exchange rates and general economic data</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><em>Sub-Section &ndash; </em>measuring unite for the chosen Main Section variable</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><em>Value &ndash; </em></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Remarks:</strong></h4>
<h4>Quoting from the UBS methodology explanations (here) wages were calculated the following way:</h4>
<h4>&ldquo;For the study's second main ingredient, earnings, we created a reference profile of 15 professions to represent the structure of the working population in Europe. We included profiles of workers of varying ages, family status, work experience and education levels.</h4>
<h4>We collected tax and social security information using PwC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Worldwide Tax Summaries,&rdquo; supplemented by information from local tax authorities, and corroborated our results with survey participants. Taxes were averaged for each profession, weighted and then calculated as a percentage. The social security contributions of employees and employers were gathered from PwC and KPMG sources.</h4>
<h4>Our net wages are calculated by deducting these social security contributions from gross wages and then subtracting taxes. Hourly wages in individual cities were calculated by dividing average annual gross or net wages by the average number of hours worked per year.</h4>
<h4>Public sector spending and social security systems in individual countries (and in individual cities) vary greatly, so the percentage of deductions ranges widely.&rdquo;</h4>
<h4>Here you see again that there are a lot of calculations and assumptions in variables like average net earning and the numbers shouldn&rsquo;t be used as if they were natural science results. But for comparisons within countries for different years and also for rankings between countries they should hold.</h4>
